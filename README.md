# Overview

`spl_transpiler` is a Rust + Python port of [Databricks Labs' `spl_transpiler`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/transpiler).
The goal is to provide a high-performance, highly portable, convenient tool for adapting common SPL code into PySpark code when possible, making it easy to migrate from Splunk to other data platforms for log processing.
